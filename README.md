# secure git credentials helper
Run

    ./setup-credential-manager.sh

- This shall setup gpg (key)store that shall encrypt and store the git credentials and avoids the need to enter the password again and again.
- It integrates directly with git interface so it does not need any other explicit setup apart from running the initial setup above.
